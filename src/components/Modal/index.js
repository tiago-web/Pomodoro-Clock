			<h1>About the pomodoro technique</h1>
			<div className="modal-text">
				<p>
					The technique has as an objective to make you more productive. This
					technique uses a timer to set short intervals between your work
					sections, generally 25 minutes of work and 3 to 5 minutes of interval.
					After four pomodoros (working sections) a long break should be taken
					(15 to 30 minutes) and then, start over again. You shall end when the
					time you propose to spend on the task is over.
				</p>
				<p>
					This technique can be used in any task since its goal is to make you
					more productive.
				</p>
